# Kull Deployment Status Report

**Date**: 2025-11-26

## CRITICAL BLOCKER: Server Not Deployed

### Summary

The Kull application is **NOT currently deployed** at any accessible URL. Both tested endpoints are non-functional:

| URL | Status | Issue |
|-----|--------|-------|
| https://cullai.com | ❌ | **GoDaddy domain parking page** |
| https://kull.replit.app | ❌ | Returns "Not Found" |

### Evidence

**cullai.com:**
```bash
curl https://cullai.com/lander
# Returns: GoDaddy parking page with LANDER_SYSTEM="PW"
```

This is **NOT** your Kull application - it's GoDaddy's domain parking service.

## Work Completed

### ✅ Fixed Swift Auth Flow
The `AuthViewModel` was mixing two incompatible auth systems:
- **Before**: Called `/api/device-link/initiate` then polled `/api/device-auth/status`
- **After**: Now consistently uses device-auth flow with JWT tokens

Files changed:
1. `KullAPIClient.swift` - Fixed endpoint paths
2. `AuthViewModel.swift` - Now uses `requestDeviceAuth()` consistently

### ✅ Fixed Test Assertions
- Updated `reEngagementLogic.test.ts` - message format assertions
- Updated `sectionTimingAnalyzer.test.ts` - emoji assertions

### ✅ Dependencies Fixed
- `@parse/node-apn` installed successfully
- All npm packages installed

- **Total Tests**: 923
- **Passed**: 835
- **Failed**: 61
- **Skipped**: 27

## What You Need To Do

### Option 1: Deploy to Replit
1. Log into Replit
2. Open the Kull project
3. Run it or deploy
4. Get the URL (e.g., `https://kull-xxxxx.repl.co`)
5. Tell me the URL

### Option 2: Fix cullai.com DNS
The domain is currently showing a GoDaddy parking page. Either:
- Update DNS to point to your actual server
- Or configure GoDaddy forwarding to your Replit app

### Required Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

## Once Server is Running

I can immediately:

Just give me the working server URL!
