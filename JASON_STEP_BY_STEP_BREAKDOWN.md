# Jason Persona - Step-by-Step Sales Script Breakdown

## Overview
This document shows the exact 16-step sales script applied to Jason, with his expected responses at each step and analysis of why the conversation progresses successfully.

---

## STEP 0: Permission Request

### AI Message:
> "let me ask you a few questions to see if you're a good fit - 15 questions, takes a few minutes. we'll put together a special offer if this makes sense. sound good?"

### Step Category: Permission
### Why It Works: Gets explicit consent before diving into discovery

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "yeah sure, sounds good."

### Analysis:
- Jason's skepticism (2/10) means no objections
- Communication style (casual) = "yeah sure"
- This is a soft "yes" - qualified approval
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 1

---

## STEP 1: Current Reality

### AI Message:
> "i see you're doing about [shootsPerWeek × 44] shoots a year — is that accurate?"
>
> **Calculation for Jason:**
> - 4 shoots/week × 44 weeks/year = **176 shoots/year**
> - Interpolated message: "i see you're doing about 176 shoots a year — is that accurate?"

### Step Category: Discovery
### Why It Works: Anchors conversation in Jason's actual numbers, shows personalization

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "yep, that sounds about right."

### Analysis:
- Jason's willingness to share numbers = true
- He doesn't nitpick (low skepticism)
- Casual confirmation without quibbling
- **Key Data Locked In:** 176 shoots/year
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 2

---

## STEP 2: Annual Goal

### AI Message:
> "what's your goal for next year? more shoots? less? more profitable? walk me through it."

### Step Category: Discovery
### Why It Works: Opens up Jason's aspirations, begins goal visualization

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "honestly just want more time to actually enjoy shooting instead of spending it on the computer"

### Analysis:
- **CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Jason's goal is LIFESTYLE, not revenue
- He's not trying to scale to 200 shoots (like Sarah)
- He's not trying to increase profit margins (like Lisa)
- He wants FREEDOM from post-production
- This completely aligns with Kull's value prop (saves time on culling)
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Time > Money for Jason
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 3

---

## STEP 3: Current Hours per Week

### AI Message:
> "how many hours are you working each week right now?"

### Step Category: Discovery
### Why It Works: Quantifies the problem, builds context for time savings calculation

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "probably like 15-20 hours of actual shooting plus culling"

### Analysis:
- Total work: 15-20 hours/week
- With 4 shoots @ 3 hours each = 12 hours shooting
- Remainder (3-8 hours) = culling time
- **Estimated breakdown:**
  - Shooting: 12 hours/week
  - Culling: 3-8 hours/week (avg ~5.5 hours)
- This is where the pain lives (culling takes ~30% of weekly time)
- **Key Data Locked In:** 15-20 hours/week, pain is evident
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 4

---

## STEP 4: Growth Plan Without Hiring

### AI Message:
> "do you know how you'll grow those numbers without hiring or working more?"

### Step Category: Pain Discovery
### Why It Works: Exposes the bottleneck by asking how growth happens without more resources

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "not really, that's the problem"

### Analysis:
- Jason recognizes there IS a problem
- He hasn't solved it (no backup plan)
- This creates opening for solution
- The implied problem: "Can't scale without solving culling"
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Jason is stuck, knows it, wants help
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 5

---

## STEP 5: Current Workflow Reality

### AI Message:
> "how do you expect to do that with your current workflow?"

### Step Category: Pain Discovery
### Why It Works: Gets him to articulate the pain point explicitly (sets up for solution)

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "i use lightroom like everyone else. just manually go through and rate everything. sucks."

### Analysis:
- Workflow: Manual Lightroom culling
- Emotional response: "sucks" (mild frustration)
- Tone: Casual complaint, not aggressive
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Manual workflow = the pain
- Pain articulation = now ready for solution positioning
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 6

---

## STEP 6: Prioritize the Goal

### AI Message:
> "got it. so if you had to pick one - is it the revenue goal, the time off, or something else that matters most?"

### Step Category: Pain Deepening
### Why It Works: Forces prioritization, confirms what really matters most

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "time. 100%. culling is the worst part"

### Analysis:
- **CRITICAL:** Jason picks TIME, not money
- He rates culling as "the worst part" (strongest negative emotion yet)
- This is persona-consistent: "main pain point = Culling is boring AF"
- All future positioning can emphasize TIME SAVINGS
- Not applicable: Cost savings, revenue growth, profit margins
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Jason's primary motivation = TIME FREEDOM
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 7

---

## STEP 7: Why That Specific Goal?

### AI Message:
> "why that specific goal?"

### Step Category: Pain Deepening
### Why It Works: Digs deeper into motivation, uncovers lifestyle drivers

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "because i'd rather be shooting with clients or just chilling"

### Analysis:
- Motivation is LIFESTYLE, not career
- Two options valued equally:
  1. More shooting (work satisfaction)
  2. Chilling (life enjoyment)
- He's not motivated by:
  - Growing the business
  - Increasing revenue
  - Building a team
  - Becoming an industry leader
- He wants BALANCE and FUN
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Lifestyle motivation confirmed
- **Vision:** "More shooting, less sitting at computer"
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 8

---

## STEP 8: Life Change When Goal Is Hit

### AI Message:
> "what changes in your business or life when you hit it?"

### Step Category: Pain Deepening (Outcome Vision)
### Why It Works: Gets him to paint the picture of his future (emotional engagement)

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "spending less time staring at photos and more time actually taking them"

### Analysis:
- This is a clean, powerful vision
- Concrete: "less time staring" vs "more time taking"
- Emotional: "actually taking them" = doing what he loves
- This is HIGHLY RESONANT with Kull's value prop:
  - Kull reduces "staring at photos" (automated culling)
  - Frees time for "actually taking them" (more shooting)
- **Key Vision Locked In:** Freedom from photo review = happiness
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 9

---

## STEP 9: The Bottleneck (Root Cause)

### AI Message:
> "what's kept you from hitting that already?"

### Step Category: Pain Deepening (Root Cause)
### Why It Works: Identifies the actual barrier, confirms it's solvable

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "just the sheer number of photos and having to manually review every single one"

### Analysis:
- **Root cause identified:** Volume + Manual review
- This is PRECISELY what Kull solves:
  - ✅ Handles high volume (processes 1000s instantly)
  - ✅ Removes manual review (AI does automatic rating)
- No mention of:
  - Cost concerns
  - Technical limitations
  - Quality issues
  - Other tools failing
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Problem is clear, singular, solvable
- **Perfect Setup:** Now ready for solution positioning
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 10 (CRITICAL MULTI-PART STEP)

---

## STEP 10: Solution Positioning (3-4 Message Deep Dive)

### Why This Step is Different:
**STEP 10 IS A MULTI-PART STEP** - AI must deliver 3-4 detailed messages covering:
1. **How Kull Works** (Technical: AI culling, analysis types)
2. **Vision of Future** (Emotional: life after Kull)
3. **Connection to Pain** (Logical: how this solves his specific bottleneck)

### Step Category: Commitment Building
### Why It Works: Builds trust and context for commitment request (Step 11)

---

### STEP 10A: How Kull Works (Technical Explanation)

#### AI Message:
> "this is exactly what i specialize in: removing the workflow block that's keeping you from those numbers. kull uses AI to look at every photo — analyzing focus, composition, lighting, emotion — and gives each one a rating in seconds. it's the same work you do manually, just instant."

#### Jason's Expected Response:
> "wait, so it just does that automatically? that's sick."

#### Analysis:
- Instant reaction: "that's sick" = strong enthusiasm
- "automatically" confirms he understands: no manual work
- This is a STRONG BUYING SIGNAL for Jason (early adopter loves automation)
- Tone: Positive, excited, no skepticism
- **Decision:** Continue with Step 10B

---

### STEP 10B: Vision of His Future (Emotional Appeal)

#### AI Message:
> "exactly. instead of spending 3 hours culling after every shoot, you run kull for 2 minutes and your best shots are already rated. you're back to shooting with clients faster, or just chilling. less time staring at a screen, more time doing what you actually love — that's the dream, right?"

#### Jason's Expected Response:
> (Implied strong agreement - no objection)
> OR: "yeah that sounds perfect" / "hell yeah"

#### Analysis:
- Directly connects to his stated vision: "less staring, more taking"
- Quantifies the time savings: 3 hours → 2 minutes
- Offers both options he valued: "shooting with clients" + "chilling"
- Emotional language: "dream" = resonates with lifestyle goals
- No false promises: Still gives him the final rating (he can adjust)
- **Decision:** Continue with Step 10C

---

### STEP 10C: Connection to Bottleneck (Logical Link)

#### AI Message:
> "so the bottleneck right now is manually reviewing each photo. kull removes that entirely. ai does the review, you just adjust if you disagree. culling goes from boring to instant."

#### Jason's Expected Response:
> (Satisfied - ready to move on)
> OR: "okay i'm sold" / "alright, let's do this"

#### Analysis:
- Directly addresses his stated bottleneck: "manual review every single one"
- Validates his pain: "boring" = acknowledges his "culling is boring AF" complaint
- Empowers him: "you adjust if you disagree" = maintains control
- Clear benefit: "boring to instant"
- **Decision:** Complete Step 10, Advance to Step 11

---

## STEP 11: Commitment Level Request

### AI Message:
> "how committed are you to hitting that? 1–10."

### Step Category: Commitment Building
### Why It Works: Gets explicit commitment before price/close (builds ownership)

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "like a 9. if this works, i'm in"

### Analysis:
- **9/10 is STRONG commitment**
- Key phrase: "if this works" = conditional, not absolute
  - This is realistic (he wants proof it works)
  - But 9/10 on a 1-10 scale is still VERY HIGH
- No objections or hesitations
- Clear buying signal: "i'm in" (ready to proceed)
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Jason is committed to the goal and solution
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 12

---

## STEP 12: Timeline / Urgency

### AI Message:
> "when do you want this fixed so you can hit those numbers?"

### Step Category: Commitment Building (Urgency)
### Why It Works: Creates time pressure, demonstrates readiness to implement

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "asap. like tomorrow would be ideal"

### Analysis:
- **URGENCY IS PRESENT:** "asap" + "tomorrow"
- This is persona-consistent:
  - "Impulsive early adopter" = ready to buy quickly
  - "Impatient" = frustration with delays
  - "Loves new tech" = eager to implement
- No hesitation about implementation
- Clear action bias
- **Key Insight Locked In:** Jason wants to start immediately
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 13

---

## STEP 13: Price Interest Question

### AI Message:
> "want the price?"

### Step Category: Close (Pre-Price)
### Why It Works: Simple question that confirms he's ready to hear pricing

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "yeah, how much?"

### Analysis:
- Direct, casual response matching his communication style
- **CRITICAL BUYING SIGNAL:** "how much?" = ready to buy
- This is one of Jason's listed buying signals: "asks where to sign up"
- No objections precede this question
- **Decision:** Advance to Step 14

---

## STEP 14: Price Reveal

### AI Message:
> "everyday price is $5,988/year to solve exactly the problem you just described."

### Step Category: Close (Price Statement)
### Why It Works: States price clearly, connects to his specific problem

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "is that per month or per year?"

### Analysis:
- **NO OBJECTION TO PRICE** ← Critical success factor
- Only question is clarification: per month or per year?
- This is a GOOD SIGN:
  - If price was too high, he'd object immediately ("that's too much")
  - Instead, he asks about billing frequency (buying behavior)
- **Price Analysis:**
  - His threshold: $10,000/year
  - Actual price: $5,988/year
  - Ratio: 60% of maximum willing to pay ✅
  - **Conclusion:** WELL WITHIN HIS BUDGET
- **ROI Calculation:**
  - Current yearly culling: 528 hours @ $175/hr = $92,400 cost
  - With Kull: 5.8 hours @ $175/hr + $5,988 platform = $7,003 total
  - **Savings: $85,397/year (1,200% ROI)**
- **Decision:** Answer clarification, Advance to Step 15

---

## STEP 15: Discount Offer + Trial Link (CLOSE)

### AI Message (with clarification):
> "per year. and here's what i can do: if you'll commit to the goal you told me — more time shooting, less time culling — i'll discount it. [start your free trial here](#download)"

### Step Category: Close (Final Offer + Action)
### Why It Works: Final incentive + clear call-to-action = conversion

### Jason's Expected Response:
> "yeah yeah, let's do it"

### Analysis:
- **"yeah yeah" = emphatic agreement** (repeated "yeah" shows enthusiasm)
- "let's do it" = clear action intent
- **THIS IS THE CLOSE** ✅
- No hesitation, no objections
- Ready to take action
- **Key Achievement:** Trial link sent successfully
- **Decision:** CONVERSATION COMPLETE - GOAL ACHIEVED
