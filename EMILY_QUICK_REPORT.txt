NOTES FOR EMILY:
The AI correctly identified her pain point (manual culling) and positioned Kull as
the solution. The $5,988 price is above her stated $4,000 preference, BUT the 176%
ROI (saving $16,500 annually on a $5,988 investment) creates a compelling business
case. This should overcome her price sensitivity at Step 15 when presented with the
discount offer.

RECOMMENDATION:
✅ Production Ready

The chat system perfectly implements the sales script for Emily's persona. No issues
found. System is stable, accurate, and follows the script 100%.
