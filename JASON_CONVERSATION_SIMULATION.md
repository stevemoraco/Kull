## TURN 11: Solution Explanation (3-Part Message)

**AI Message 10a (How it works):**
> "this is exactly what i specialize in: removing the workflow block that's keeping you from those numbers. here's how: kull uses AI to look at every photo — analyzing focus, composition, lighting, emotion — and gives each one a rating in seconds. it's the same work you do manually, just instant."

**Jason:**
> "wait, so it just does that automatically? that's sick."

**AI Message 10b (Vision):**
> "exactly. instead of spending 3 hours culling after every shoot, you run kull for 2 minutes and your best shots are already rated. you're back to shooting with clients faster, or just chilling. less time staring at a screen, more time doing what you actually love — that's the dream, right?"

**Jason (implied):**
> (Nods in agreement)

**AI Message 10c (Connection):**
> "so the bottleneck right now is manually reviewing each photo. kull removes that entirely. ai does the review, you just adjust if you disagree. culling goes from boring to instant."

> (No objection)

**Sentiment:** Positive | **Confidence:** 80%

---

## TURN 13: Urgency Timeline

**AI (Step 12):**
> "when do you want this fixed so you can hit those numbers?"

---

## TURN 15: Price Reveal

**AI (Step 14):**

## ROI Analysis for Jason

### Current State (Without Kull)
- Yearly shoots: 176 (4/week × 44 weeks)
- Culling time per shoot: 3 hours
- Total yearly culling: 528 hours/year
- Cost: 528 × $175/hr = **$92,400/year in labor**

### With Kull
- AI processing: 2 minutes/shoot
- Total yearly processing: 5.8 hours/year
- Cost: 5.8 × $175/hr = $1,015/year in labor
- Platform cost: $5,988/year
- Total investment: $7,003/year
- **Savings: $92,400 - $7,003 = $85,397/year**

### Even Conservative Estimate
- Assume Kull only saves 50% of time (manual review still needed)
- Savings: 264 hours × $175/hr = $46,200/year
- Cost: $7,003/year
- **Net: $39,197/year benefit**

**Result:** At any reasonable assumption, Kull pays for itself 10-30x over in Jason's case.
