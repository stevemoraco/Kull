       Status: Ready for testing

Issues:
       1. Step 10 Prerequisite Enforcement (MEDIUM RISK)
          Status: Script includes 3-part requirement, validation needs verification
          Details: Cannot proceed to Step 11 until all 3 parts explained
                   - Part 1: How Kull works (AI photo analysis)
                   - Part 2: Vision of her life after Kull
                   - Part 3: Connection to her bottleneck (culling automation)

       2. Step 11 Prerequisite Validation (MEDIUM RISK)
          Status: Logic present, enforcement needs testing

PERSONA PROFILE - MARIA
================================================================================

Demographics:
       Name: Maria
       Type: Budget-Conscious Mom
       Business: Family photography (side business)
       Shoots/Week: 2
       Hours/Shoot: 4
       Billable Rate: $80/hr

Financial Reality:
       Annual Shoots: 88 (2/week × 44 weeks)
       Annual Culling Hours: 352 hours (2 shoots/week × 4 hours × 44 weeks)
       Annual Waste on Manual Culling: $28,160 (352 hours × $80/hr)
       Price Threshold: $3,500/year (budget constraint)
       Kull List Price: $5,988/year (above her threshold)

Pain Points:
       1. Burnout: Working 45-50 hours/week (everything herself)
       2. Family Impact: Kids barely see her during wedding season
       3. Bottleneck: Manual culling = 2-3 hours per shoot (mindless, repeated)
       4. Growth Block: Can't book more shoots without solving culling
       5. Time Scarcity: No weekends, no vacation, no personal time

Motivation Analysis:
       Primary Driver: FAMILY TIME (emotional, strongest)
       Secondary: Revenue growth (4 shoots/week, same income)
       Commitment: HIGH (8-9 out of 10) when emotionally engaged
       Buying Signal: URGENCY (in thick of wedding season, immediate need)
       Price Sensitivity: MEDIUM (she has a limit, but ROI can justify)

Skepticism Profile:
       Type: Price-skeptical, not feature-skeptical
       Level: 6/10 (medium)
       Trigger: "$5,988 is expensive for a side business"
       Resolution: Show ROI (she wastes 5.8x more annually)

================================================================================
15-TURN TEST SCENARIO
================================================================================

TURN 1 (Step 0: Permission)
       Maria: "Yeah, I can do a few minutes. We've had a lot on our plate lately."
       Expected: Move to Step 1
       Validation: Metadata present, no repetition

TURN 2 (Step 1: Current Reality)
       Maria: "That sounds about right, maybe even a bit more in summer"
       Expected: AI references "88 shoots a year" (interpolated from 2 × 44)
       Validation: Calculator values working, context aware

TURN 3 (Step 2: Goal for Next Year)
       Maria: "Honestly, I just want to stop feeling so burnt out. Maybe 3-4 shoots a week if I can automate the culling part"
       Expected: Move to Step 3
       Validation: Goals captured, automation pain point noted

TURN 4 (Step 3: Hours Per Week)
       Maria: "45-50 hours. I'm doing everything myself - shoots, culling, editing, client work"
       Expected: Move to Step 4
       Validation: Workload captured, context awareness

TURN 5 (Step 4: Growth Plan)
       Maria: "That's the thing... I'm not sure. Everything takes so long, especially culling."
       Expected: Move to Step 5
       Validation: Uncertainty about growth without scaling hours

TURN 6 (Step 5: Current Workflow)
       Maria: "Honestly, that's what's killing me. I spend like 2-3 hours per shoot just picking the good ones. It's mindless."
       Expected: Move to Step 6
       Validation: CULLING BOTTLENECK IDENTIFIED - 2-3 hours per shoot

TURN 7 (Step 6: Prioritize Goal)
       Maria: "Time off. I need weekends back. My kids barely see me during wedding season."
       Expected: Move to Step 7
       Validation: PRIMARY MOTIVATION = FAMILY TIME (emotional)

TURN 8 (Step 7: Why That Goal?)
       Maria: "My oldest asked why I work so much. That hit hard. Also money - if I could do 4 shoots a week instead of 2, I could make more without working more hours total."
       Expected: Move to Step 8
       Validation: EMOTIONAL DRIVER + FINANCIAL LOGIC

TURN 9 (Step 8: Outcome Vision)
       Maria: "I get my family back. Time with my kids. Maybe a real vacation in the summer instead of just staying home exhausted."
       Expected: Move to Step 9
       Validation: VISION = Family time, vacation, weekends

TURN 10 (Step 9: The Bottleneck)
       Maria: "The culling. It's the only thing preventing me from booking more shoots. I know my editing is fast, my shooting is fast... it's just that manual culling step."
       Expected: Move to Step 10
       Validation: BOTTLENECK CLEARLY IDENTIFIED = CULLING

TURN 11 (Step 10: Position Solution) ⚠️ CRITICAL PREREQUISITE
       Maria: "Yeah, maybe. What do you have in mind?"
       Expected: AI MUST provide 3-part explanation:
                1. How Kull works (AI rates photos in 30 sec: focus, composition, lighting)
                2. Vision of her life after Kull (weekends free, kids see her more, 4 shoots/week)
                3. Connection to bottleneck (AI culling removes the 2-3 hour manual block)
       Validation: All 3 parts must be in response before moving to Step 11
       CRITICAL: Script definition requires this. Enforcement must be verified.

TURN 12 (Step 11: Commitment Level) ⚠️ PREREQUISITE CHECK REQUIRED
       Maria: "Pretty committed, 8 or 9. If this actually works, it solves my biggest problem."
       Expected: ONLY ask this question if Step 10's 3 parts were completed
       Prerequisite Check: aiStepValidator.ts must validate Step 10 response included all 3 parts
       Validation: High commitment shown (8-9 out of 10), tied to bottleneck solution

TURN 13 (Step 12: Timeline)
       Maria: "ASAP, honestly. We're in the thick of wedding season right now."
       Expected: Move to Step 13
       Validation: URGENCY captured = immediate need

TURN 14 (Step 13: Price Reveal)
       Maria: "Yeah, how much are we talking?"
       Expected: User proactively asked about price
       Conditional Logic: Skip Step 13 confirmation, go straight to Step 14 (she already wants price)
       Validation: chatService.ts line 747-761 handles this with userAskedAboutPrice flag

TURN 15 (Step 14: State Price) ⚠️ CRITICAL OBJECTION HANDLING
       AI: "Everyday price is $5,988/year to solve exactly the problem you just described."
       Maria: "Wait... that's expensive. I was thinking more like $2k, $3k max. We're not making that much as a side business right now."
       Expected AI Response (CRITICAL):
              1. Acknowledge her concern (empathy, not dismissal)
              2. Show the math: "You're currently wasting $28,160/year on manual culling"
              3. Frame investment: "$5,988/year eliminates that entire waste"
              4. Show payback: "That pays for itself in just 2-3 weeks of time saved"
              5. Offer discount: "Since you're committed to the goal, here's a special offer"
              6. Provide trial: [start your free trial here](#download)
       Validation: ROI math spontaneously generated, objection handled with empathy

TURN 16 (Step 15: Discount Close)
       Expected: 
              Statement: "Alright — if you'll commit to the goal you told me, I'll discount it."
