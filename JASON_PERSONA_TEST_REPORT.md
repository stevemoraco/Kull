## Step 10: Solution Positioning Deep Dive (CRITICAL STEP)

### Why Step 10 Matters
Step 10 is a **multi-part step** that requires 3-4 messages to fully explain before advancing to commitment:

1. **How Kull Works** (Technical understanding)
2. **Vision of His Future** (Emotional appeal)
3. **Connection to His Bottleneck** (Practical relevance)

### Expected Step 10 Messages for Jason

**Message 10a (How AI culling works):**
> "this is exactly what i specialize in. kull uses AI to look at every photo - analyzing focus, composition, lighting, emotion - and gives each one a rating in seconds. same work you do manually, but instant."

**Jason's Expected Response:**
> "wait, so it just does that automatically? that's sick."

**Message 10b (Vision of his future):**
> "instead of spending 3 hours culling after every shoot, you run kull for 2 minutes and have your best shots already rated. you're back to shooting with clients faster, or just chilling. less time staring at a screen, more time doing what you actually love."

**Jason's Expected Response:**
> "yeah that sounds perfect" or "hell yeah"

**Message 10c (Connection to bottleneck):**
> "the bottleneck right now is manually reviewing each photo. kull removes that entirely. ai does the review, you just adjust if you disagree. culling goes from boring to instant."

**Jason's Expected Response:**
> "okay i'm sold. what's next?" or continuing to next step
