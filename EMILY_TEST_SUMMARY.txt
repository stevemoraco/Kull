KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS
========================================

Issue 1: Trial Link Not Tested
- Current status: Test ended at Step 14
- Expected: Step 15 should have [start your free trial](#download)
- Impact: Low (design is sound, just not tested to completion)
- Recommendation: Continue test to Step 15 to verify link

Issue 2: Conversation State Not Persisted
- Current: Each test session starts fresh
- Expected: Real app saves conversation history
- Impact: None for this test (working as designed)
- Note: Production app will maintain full chat history

Issue 3: Price > Emily's Stated Threshold
- Emily said: "price matters" (implied $4k budget)
- Actual price: $5,988
- Concern: May trigger objection at Step 15
- Mitigation: ROI of 176% should overcome concern
- AI should emphasize: "You're wasting $16,500 now, this pays for itself in 4 weeks"
