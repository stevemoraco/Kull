# Kull iOS & iPadOS Companion

The SwiftUI universal app will let photographers:

- Browse their Mac's shared folder catalog and queue shoots remotely
- Monitor AI culling progress, cost burn, and credit balances in real time
- Manage saved prompts, marketplace browsing, and profile metadata on the go

Swift package targets will be added here once we initialize the Xcode workspace.
