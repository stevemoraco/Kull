# Kull macOS Menubar App

This target will house the SwiftUI/AppKit code for the Kull menubar experience. The implementation will:

- Present a persistent status item with drag-and-drop window launcher
- Manage security-scoped bookmarks for watched shoot folders
- Coordinate with the shared orchestration engine for batching and metadata updates
- Expose progress, credit usage, and prompt selection UI in macOS-native patterns

Xcode project scaffolding will live alongside this README once the native layers are initialized.
