## Structured Outputs (Anthropic Messages API)

> ⚠️ The official structured-output guide at docs.anthropic.com blocked automated access, so this file is a placeholder. Fill it in with the latest guidance on `response_format`, JSON Schema support, and tool output contracts when you have direct access.

- Capture how to request JSON/object responses from Claude 4.x, including schema validation behaviour.
- Document limits (payload size, nesting depth), error modes, and retry patterns.
- Note how structured outputs interact with function-calling and extended thinking traces.
- Summarize any pricing modifiers or batch API considerations once the doc is available.
