## Gemini Nano “Banana” Variant

> ⚠️ Google has not published a public markdown doc for the Banana/Nano configuration that our scraper can reach. Add the official specs (context limits, modality support, on-device requirements, and pricing guidance) once the Gemini team posts them or you can grab them manually.

Suggested coverage once available:
- model IDs and release channels for Banana builds (Android/iOS, WebAssembly, Vertex AI)
- supported modalities and maximum context size
- pricing or quota differences vs other Nano tiers
- batching, caching, and streaming constraints for on-device execution
