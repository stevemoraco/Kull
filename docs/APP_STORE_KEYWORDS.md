# Kull App Store Keywords & Metadata

## Keyword Strategy Overview

App Store keywords are critical for discoverability. Apple allows **100 characters** (no spaces count toward limit) for keyword optimization. Keywords should be:
- Relevant to app functionality
- High search volume
- Low competition (when possible)
- No duplicates from app title/subtitle

## Primary Keywords (100 Character Limit)

### Optimized Keyword String

```
photo culling,AI,Lightroom,wedding photographer,RAW,photography,image rating,photo selection,XMP,batch
```

**Character Count:** 100 characters (exact limit)

### Keyword Breakdown

| Keyword | Search Volume | Competition | Relevance | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| photo culling | Medium | Low | 10/10 | Primary feature, low competition |
| AI | High | High | 9/10 | Core technology, broad appeal |
| Lightroom | High | Medium | 10/10 | Target integration, high intent |

| batch | Medium | Medium | 8/10 | Batch processing capability |

## Alternative Keywords (Not Used, But Monitored)

These keywords were considered but excluded due to character limits or lower priority:

- **event photography** (19 chars) - Too long, covered by "wedding photographer"
- **photo editing** (13 chars) - Misleading, we don't edit photos
- **Adobe** (5 chars) - Already implied by "Lightroom"
- **camera** (6 chars) - Not directly relevant (we don't control camera)
- **portrait** (8 chars) - Too specific, fewer searches than "wedding"
- **professional** (12 chars) - Redundant with "wedding photographer"
- **studio** (6 chars) - Lower priority than event photography
- **picture** (7 chars) - Redundant with "photo"
- **sorting** (7 chars) - Less common than "culling"
- **metadata** (8 chars) - Too technical, lower search volume
- **EXIF** (4 chars) - Very niche, covered by "RAW"
- **sidecar** (7 chars) - Too technical
- **filter** (6 chars) - Ambiguous, could mean Instagram filters

## App Title & Subtitle Optimization

### Current Titles
- **App Name:** Kull - AI Photo Culling
- **Subtitle:** AI-Powered Photo Selection

### Rationale
- **"Kull"** - Brand recognition (unique, memorable)
- **"AI Photo Culling"** - Describes core functionality, includes "AI" and "photo culling" keywords
- **"AI-Powered Photo Selection"** - Reinforces AI, adds "photo selection" variant

### Alternative Titles Considered (Not Used)

1. **Kull: AI Photo Culling for Lightroom**
   - Pros: Includes "Lightroom" keyword
   - Cons: Too long, sounds like a plugin (we're not)

2. **Kull - Wedding Photo Culling AI**
   - Pros: Targets primary user segment
   - Cons: Excludes event/portrait photographers

3. **Kull: RAW Photo Rating & Selection**
   - Pros: Emphasizes RAW support
   - Cons: Doesn't mention AI (key differentiator)

4. **Kull - Professional Photo Culling**
   - Pros: Targets professionals
   - Cons: Doesn't mention AI, "professional" is weak keyword

3. **Conversion Rate**
   - % of store page views that result in downloads
   - Benchmark: 30% average for paid apps, 15% for free

4. **Download Attribution**
   - Which keywords drive most downloads?
   - Adjust keyword bids based on ROI

### Monthly Review Process

## Keyword Update Strategy

Apple allows keyword updates with each app version release. Plan keyword iterations:

### Version 1.0 (Launch)
Current keywords focused on core functionality and primary audience.

### Version 1.1 (3 months post-launch)
Based on Search Ads data:
- Replace low-performing keywords (e.g., "batch" if not driving downloads)
- Add high-intent keywords discovered via Search Ads (e.g., "cull photos fast")

### Version 1.2 (6 months post-launch)
Expand to secondary audiences:
- Add "portrait photographer" if seeing traction
- Add "event photography" if wedding market saturated

### Version 2.0 (12 months post-launch)
Reflect new features:
- Add "Capture One" if integration launched
- Add "team collaboration" if feature shipped

## Competitive Keyword Gaps

### Opportunities
Keywords competitors rank for that we should target:

1. **"photo workflow"** - Photo Mechanic ranks #1, we could compete
2. **"IPTC metadata"** - Technical term, high intent
3. **"photo triage"** - Alternative to "culling"
4. **"contact sheet"** - Old-school term still searched
5. **"proof gallery"** - Client delivery workflow

### Threats
Keywords we rank for that competitors are targeting:

1. **"AI photo culling"** - Narrative Select, FilterPixel, Aftershoot all competing
2. **"Lightroom culling"** - High competition, monitor closely
3. **"wedding photographer tools"** - Broad category, many competitors

## Long-Tail Keyword Strategy

Focus on specific, low-competition phrases:

- "cull wedding photos fast" - High intent, low competition
- "Lightroom XMP sidecar" - Technical, niche audience
- "AI photo rating for RAW" - Specific feature + format
- "batch photo culling software" - Feature + category
- "wedding photo selection tool" - Audience + feature

These don't fit in 100-character limit, but target via:
- App description copy
- Search Ads exact match campaigns
- Blog content for SEO

**Monthly:**
- Check keyword rankings
- Analyze Search Ads performance
- Monitor competitor changes

**Quarterly:**
- Update keywords with new app version (if needed)
- A/B test title/subtitle variations
