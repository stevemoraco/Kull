# Kull User Guide

## Lightroom Sync
- After a cull completes, right–click your shoot folder in Lightroom Classic and choose “Synchronize Folder…” or “Read Metadata from Files” to pull the new star ratings, color labels, titles, descriptions, and keywords from the XMP sidecars.
- Tip: enable "Automatically write changes into XMP" in Catalog Settings if you want Lightroom to save changes back to XMP as you edit.

## Model Selection
- Apple Intelligence: fully on‑device, offline, unlimited; slower throughput.
- OpenAI GPT‑5: fast cloud processing with structured outputs; costs are drawn from your monthly credits.

## Prompts & Marketplace
- Choose a default preset or search the marketplace for community prompts. Save your favorites and vote to help others discover the best templates.

## Credits
- Your available credits are shown in the app. You can buy top‑ups at any time. Estimated shoots remaining is calculated from your plan and recent usage.

## Reports
- When a run completes, Kull can generate a short narrative summary and email it to you along with 5★/4★ counts for quick client handoff.
