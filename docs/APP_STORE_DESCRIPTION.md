## Description (4000 characters max)

**Stop wasting time sorting photos. Start creating.**

Kull is the world's fastest AI photo culling platform built exclusively for professional photographers. Process thousands of photos in seconds—not hours—with AI that understands technical quality, emotional moments, and what makes a keeper.

**WHY PHOTOGRAPHERS LOVE KULL**

• **Instant Results**: 1,000 photos rated in under 30 seconds
• **Lightroom-Ready**: Direct XMP sidecar export with star ratings and color labels
• **Professional Accuracy**: AI trained on professional photography standards
• **Radical Transparency**: See exactly what you pay (no hidden fees or confusing credits)
• **Multi-Platform**: macOS menu bar app + iOS companion for on-the-go monitoring

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. **Import Your Shoot**: Drag a folder of RAW or JPEG images
2. **AI Analyzes Everything**: Technical quality, composition, emotion, timing, subject sharpness
3. **Get Rated Photos**: Star ratings (1-5), color labels, and detailed quality metrics
4. **Open in Lightroom**: XMP files appear alongside your photos—no manual import needed

**INTELLIGENT RATING SYSTEM**

Kull's AI evaluates every photo across multiple dimensions:

• **Focus Accuracy**: Tack-sharp subjects vs. soft background blur
• **Moment Timing**: Peak action, genuine expressions, eyes open
• **Composition**: Rule of thirds, framing, balance, leading lines
• **Lighting Quality**: Direction, mood, dynamic range
• **Emotional Impact**: Capturing real moments, not forced poses
• **Duplicate Detection**: Groups similar shots, keeps the best

**AI MODELS YOU CAN TRUST**

Choose from the latest AI providers:
• **GPT-5 Nano** (OpenAI) - Default, ultra-fast
• **Claude Haiku 4.5** (Anthropic) - Best reasoning
• **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** (Google) - Most affordable
• **Grok 2 Vision** (xAI) - Fast inference with vision support
• **Apple Intelligence** (macOS 15+) - FREE on-device processing

**THREE PROCESSING MODES**

1. **Default (Fast)**: Cloud AI, processes 1,000 photos in ~30 seconds
2. **Economy (Batch)**: 50% cheaper, results in 10-30 minutes
3. **Local (On-Device)**: FREE, 100% private, slower (macOS only)

**PRICING THAT MAKES SENSE**

No confusing "credits." Just pay for what you use:
• $0.004 per image (gpt-5-nano)
• $0.002 per image (economy mode)
• FREE (on-device mode)

Example: 1,000-photo wedding shoot = $4.00 (or $2.00 economy, or FREE local)

Annual subscriptions available with prepaid balance.

## App Store Optimization (ASO) Strategy

### Title Strategy
"Kull - AI Photo Culling" balances brand recognition with keyword optimization.

### Keyword Targeting
Focus on long-tail keywords:
- "photo culling software"
- "Lightroom AI"
- "wedding photographer tools"
- "RAW photo rating"

### Localization
Start with English (US), expand to:
- English (UK, AU, CA)
- Spanish (ES, MX, LATAM)
- French (FR, CA)
- German (DE)
- Japanese (JP)

### Competitor Analysis
Differentiate from:
- **Photo Mechanic**: Faster AI vs manual selection
- **Narrative Select**: More affordable, multi-provider AI
- **FilterPixel**: Transparent pricing, no subscription lock-in
- **Lightroom**: AI-powered culling BEFORE import, not after
